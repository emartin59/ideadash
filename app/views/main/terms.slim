  # Terms of Service

  #### IDEADASH INC.

  Effective May 28, 2016

  BETA WARNING: This site is currently in a beta launch. Please be aware that site policies are fluid and may change at any time. We may not strictly adhere to the processes, procedures, policies, and systems set forth in this Terms of Service due to technical issues, unforeseen circumstances, or simply something we overlooked. Also, be aware that site service and functionality may be sporadic, unreliable, buggy, and/or slow. This early launch is an opportunity for you to experience this brand new platform, and is a huge help for us because we're getting valuable usage trends and/or feedback from you or people like you. Please email comments, feedback, or suggestions to feedback@ideadash.com - Please email questions, issues, or anything else to help@ideadash.com - Thank you for making ideaDash a success.

  These Terms of Service (The "Terms of Service") govern use of the websites and services (the "Services") of IDEADASH INC., a Delaware corporation (together with its affiliates, "IDEADASH"). By using the Services, Users agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, all applicable laws and all conditions or policies referenced here (collectively, the "Terms"). IDEADASH may amend the Terms at any time by posting a revised version of the Terms of Service. Access to or continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

  ### Definitions

  In these Terms, we refer to those posting ideas as "idea posters" and to the ideas raising funds as "ideas". Those who give funds toward ideas are called "backers". Those who propose idea implementations are called "implementation proposers". Those implementation proposers who win the most votes of the backers for a particular idea are call "implementers". They then go on to implement the idea according to their implementation proposal. Other people using the site, including the previously mentioned people, are called users. A month is a calendar month is called a "month" and starts on the first and ends anywhere between the end of the day on the 28th to the 31st of the month depending on the month. Much of IDEADASH is run on a monthly schedule, so much of the components of the service, such as fundraising for ideas, starts on the first of each month and runs through the end of that month, etc. Each of the monthly components start over at the beginning of each new month, so while phase two is starting, a new phase one is starting as well, for example.

  ### IDEADASH is a Platform

  IDEADASH is an online crowdfunding platform for people seeking to raise funds for their ideas, to contribute to the ideas of others, and to implement others" posted ideas or their own posted ideas. At any time throughout a month, people may post an idea (restrictions apply), and during that month the idea raises funds from backers. After that month the idea can no longer raise funds on the platform. During the first twenty-one days of the second month the idea can receive implementation proposals from implementation proposers. Throughout the second month and until the end of the second month, backers each have one vote that they may put towards an implementation proposal or other options. They may be able to change their vote during this time. After the end of the second month, the option with more votes than any other, if there is one, is proceeded with. After funds are collected and up to the fortieth day after the second month some or all of the funds will be dispersed into users accounts. At that time the funds may be automatically sent to users, or a request may be required from the user, in which case IDEADASH has up to ten business day to pay out those funds. Typically, 2.9% + 30 cents (USD) will go to the payment provider for each transaction processed as a transaction fee. After this, percentages of the raised funds, after any and all transactions fees, will be given out in the following ways: the idea poster will receive 10% of the funds, IDEADASH will receive 5% of the funds, and the eventual implementer, if any is successfully voted to become an implementer, will receive 85% of the funds. When receiving paid out funds, idea posters and implementers may incur additional transaction fees that can lessen the funds that they will receive. People who post ideas are not necessarily the ones who implement the idea; rather, all backers of an idea get one vote towards an implementation proposal and the one implementation proposal that gets more votes than any other option gets most of the money and the implementation proposer who is now the implementer must implement the idea according to their implementation proposal. IDEADASH may not and will not be held responsible if an implementer does or does not, in whole or in part, execute their implementation proposal. IDEADASH is not responsible for any ideas posted, comments posted, implementation proposals posted, or any implementation or implementation attempt of anything posted on the site. Please note that the implementation proposal can be quite different from the original idea, and this is allowed and even encouraged in some cases. An implementer needs to follow the implementation proposal that they have submitted, not the original idea. After the second month, the voting month, the following can happen depending on whether one option gets more votes than all of the others or not. If no votes are cast, or if there is a tie in the top option for the number of votes, no one will become the implementer at that time and the idea will keep its funds for the next month to see if it gets proposals or votes on those proposals, and then the idea progresses as before if an implementation proposal receives more votes than any other option. If no option receives more votes than any other than the idea can continue to revert to the implementation proposal phase at the beginning of each new month for multiple months. IDEADASH reserves the right to stop this process of continually waiting for the idea to get an implementer after the end of any given month, at which time IDEADASH will return only the portion of the funds, or an equivalent virtual currency, that is equal to the amount of funds that would have gone to an implementer, to the backers. The voting may also have two other options for backers who are not satisfied with any of a given idea"s implementation proposal(s). Backers may also vote to extend the idea for another month for more, other, existing, or updated implementation proposals to be submitted, or backers may vote to cancel the idea"s backing and get back part of the funds they gave, either real or as virtual currency. They will only get funds back in the amount that would have gone to an implementer of the idea. In any event, if any of these two options or one of the implementation proposals gets more votes than any other option, that is the option that will be proceeded with. IDEADASH makes no representations about the usefulness, quality, safety, morality, legality, viability, or marketability of any Idea, Implementation Proposal, Funding Vehicle, or Funds. IDEADASH makes no representations about the truth or accuracy of any User Content posted on the Site, such as, but not limited to, the contents of any ideas, implementation proposals, comments, or the true identity of a particular user, their name, or their email address. IDEADASH does not represent that implementer(s), or for that matter, idea poster(s) or implementation proposer(s), will carry out any or all implementation proposal(s), idea(s), or comment(s); or that funds will be used as described in an implementation proposal, idea, or comment.

IDEADASH is also not responsible, or under any obligation, under any circumstance, to take any action against a User, Idea Poster, Implementation Proposer, or Implementer for any or no reason, except as required by law.

Idea Posters are solely responsible for determining how to treat any received Funds for tax purposes, and are solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes.

  ### Implementers

  Any implementation proposal must be submitted by someone who is 18 years old or older, since they are legally bound to carry out the implementation if they are voted in to become the implementer: this age is the age of majority and means that they can enter into a legal agreement with the backers. Implementers are legally bound to perform on any promise, action, and/or commitment that they said they would do in their implementation proposal. Implementers will respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed to them by IDEADASH or any Backer. If any implementer is unable to fulfill any promise, action, and/or commitment that they said they would do in their implementation proposal, the implementer must work with the Backers to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include refunding their backing Funds. Implementers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the use of Funds and in carrying out their implementation proposal. Implementers are responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes on Funds. IDEADASH may attempt to verify the identity and other information provided to us by Implementers, and we may delay, withhold, reverse or refund any Funds or other amounts without notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such information to our satisfaction.

  ### Backers
  Backers are solely responsible for asking questions and investigating Implementation Proposers, Implementation Proposals, and Ideas to the extent they feel is necessary before funding an idea. They understand that no satisfactory Implementation Proposer may ever come forward, an Implementer may get chosen who they don"t desire, or an Implementation Proposer who they do desire might get passed over due to the nature of voting on the platform.  All backing Funds are made voluntarily and at the sole discretion and risk of the Backer. IDEADASH does not guarantee that Funds will be used as promised, that Implementers will carry out their Implementation proposal faithfully, or that the idea or implementation as carried out will achieve its goals, or any perceived goal(s) that you may have had for the idea or implementation proposal. IDEADASH does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties for or about the usefulness, quality, safety, morality, marketability, or legality of any implementation proposal(s), idea(s), or comment(s), or the truth or accuracy of User Content posted on the Site or Services.
