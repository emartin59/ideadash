Eric founded ideadash so that anyone with an idea has the opportunity to make money from the idea and the opportunity to benefit others with the idea. And all of this is possible even when the person who posts the idea cannot or will not implement the idea.

A follower of Jesus, Eric is creating and maintaining this site "in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him." (from the NIV, part of Colossians 3:17)

He has a wife, Melody, and two daughters, Noelle and Grace. Previously, Eric and Melody created a card game for kids, called Animal Herders. In 2015 he won Jet.com’s nationwide marketing competition called Jet Insider. He won first place out of over 350,000 Insiders by getting over 8,000 people to signup for Jet.com before its launch later that year.

Little known fact: Turkey Vultures are Eric’s favorite animal.
